Blending the vibration that is me with the vibration that is aligned with that which I desire.
Creating physicality that manifests the reality harmoneous vibrational congruity requires.

There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.
